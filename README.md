The objective of this project is to extract signal from high-dimensional biological data using scPCA and provide a rich comparison of the proposed methodology to other popular techniques currently relied upon for the exploration of high-dimensional biological data.

## Prerequisites:
1. BiocManager Packages -Installation Guide: [https://bioconductor.org/install/#install-bioconductor-packages](https://bioconductor.org/install/#install-bioconductor-packages)
2. The [txt file](/Exploring-High-Dimensional-Biological-Data-Using-scPCA/Packages to be installed.txt) containing list of all the packages to be installed has been uploaded in the repository.   

## Instructions:
### BMMC dataset
1. Go to file: [analyses\bmmc_data\bmmc_analysis.Rmd](analyses\bmmc_data\bmmc_analysis.Rmd)
2. Change Path on Line 30 to the desired folder containing load_count_data.R file.
3. Run the code chunks sequentially to avoid any errors. 

### Dengue dataset
1. Go to file: [analyses\dengue_data\dengue_analysis.Rmd](analyses\dengue_data\dengue_analysis.Rmd)
2. Change Path on Line 323 to the desired folder containing scpca.Rdata file.
3. Run the code chunks sequentially to avoid any errors.
